# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Project Synopsis
In this project, we utilized data from two different XLSX files, which were merged to extract specific information as outlined in the Jupyter Notebook starter code. The extraction process involved tasks such as identifying subcategories, organizing data into structured DataFrames, converting data types, renaming columns, and dropping unnecessary columns to name a few. After cleaning and preparing the data, we generated new CSV files and used these to create database-ready tables.

Once the Jupyter Notebook code was finalized, we exported the processed data, resulting in four new CSV files (Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contacts) created from the original XLSX files. Additionally, an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was developed to visually illustrate the relationships between the tables within the database (crowdfunding_db), ensuring a clear understanding of the data structure and connections.

Based on the specific requirements mentioned in the rubric, we have attached all files necessary for the project.
